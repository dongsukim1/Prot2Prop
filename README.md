# Prot2Prop
Structure-aware fine-tuning of protein language models for joint prediction of multiple developability properties from protein structure inputs.

## Objectives
This project aims to train **one shared adapter + task‑specific heads** for key developability properties relevant to enzymes, binders, synthetic biology, and related protein engineering tasks.

- [ ] Aggregate data from multiple datasets for properties of interest
- [ ] Train a single adapter (or LoRA block) on all properties with a separate head per property.
- [ ] Use a multi‑task loss with masking for missing labels.
- [ ] Repeat training to build ensembles and evaluate ensembling strategies.

### Properties (Primary)
- Thermal unfolding metrics (Tm, ΔG)
- Stability under pH or ionic strength shifts
- Aggregation propensity
- Solubility
- Secretion signal / signal peptide presence
- Protease susceptibility / half-life
- Immunogenicity / epitope likelihood
- Oligomerization state / assembly propensity
- Metal binding / cofactor dependence
- Membrane association / transmembrane topology

## Properties (Secondary)
Properties for future investigation (lower priority and potentially less synergistic with the primary set).
- Binding affinity (protein–protein, protein–ligand)
- Enzymatic activity (kcat, Km, specificity)
- Expression yield / solubility in specific hosts
- Subcellular localization
- Allosteric regulation potential
- Disorder content / intrinsically disordered regions
- PTM site likelihood (phosphorylation, glycosylation, ubiquitination, acetylation)

> I suggest we ignore these for the time being, as they all require some degree of auxiliary information. For example, binding affinity depends on interaction partners, while enzymatic activity and kcat are only meaningful with substrate information. Without this context, I'm of the opinion that these properties would be of limited value. That said, I’ve kept them listed to provide a sense of future direction for the project, once the initial set of primary properties has been implemented.

## Motivation
The current ecosystem provides many task-specific models for properties such as solubility and stability, but few efforts unify these objectives within a single, structure-aware model. A multi-property framework can reduce parameter count and improve throughput, while potentially improving accuracy through shared signal across correlated biochemical traits (e.g., stability-related metrics).

Additionally, widely used tools (e.g., NetSolP-1.0) rely on older base models and datasets. With improved architectures, larger corpora, and better training algorithms now available, a modern, multi-property, structure-aware approach is both timely and high-impact.
